    * IOS lies above the bridge

  * [Investigation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1njgR3kGGaWoKNLxcsB1YOqlBPYZFg4xS#scrollTo=AHCw-DXtjOzv)
    * Found out: the cross-section has multiple peaks. I have handling for the largest peak, but any peak may cause this issue on its trailing side.
    * Action: will talk to an expert whether this should be handled or just leave it for unlikely minor shortcoming.
