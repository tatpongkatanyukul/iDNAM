## Evaluation of the treatment

  * Aveleolar-Ridge Score (ARS)
    * joint meet projection / joint sharpness (matching curve)
    * gap size
  * initial ARS: score of the initial aveleolar ridge of a patient: how good/bad the patient's ridge is.
  * final ARS: score of the final ridge: how good the ridge is after the treatment.
