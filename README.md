# My strategy
* Since Aj Wasu covers the main and essential part, I am quite free to explore anything I wish.
* The hard part of this project is that I have to write python code in Blender editor, which is not quite friendly. The import file is too much of a trouble.
  * It may be more productive to exprot the essential data and work in my comfortable environment like Colab.

# Plan
Two main tasks
* 1. Finding edges
  * Option 1.1. **Self-organizing map**
  * Option 1.2. Features ($z$, $\vec{n}$, $\Delta \vec{n}$) and ANN
  * Option 1.3. Surface CNN

* 2. Bridging gap
  * Option 2.1. **NURBS: maximization of ridge continuity: grad and momentum (or Jacobian)**
  * Option 2.2. Patient's palates: minimization of rotation and translation   
 
* 3. Assessing results
  * I am thinking out having results from multiple approaches and have experts (K. June, Aj Cartoon) blindly grade the results.
  * Check out Bleu score for reference
 
All of all, I'll go with NURBS first!
